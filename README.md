## 🐸 Flexbox Froggy Solutions – Explained! 🚀

Below are the solutions for each level of **Flexbox Froggy**, along with simple explanations to help you understand how they work.

---

### 🎯 **Positioning Frogs Along the Main Axis (justify-content)**
1️⃣ **`justify-content: flex-end;`**  
   → Moves all frogs to the right side of the pond.  

2️⃣ **`justify-content: center;`**  
   → Centers the frogs in the middle of the pond.  

3️⃣ **`justify-content: space-around;`**  
   → Distributes the frogs evenly, with space on both sides of each frog.  

4️⃣ **`justify-content: space-between;`**  
   → Spreads the frogs across the pond, with equal space between them but none at the edges.  

---

### 📏 **Positioning Frogs Along the Cross Axis (align-items)**
5️⃣ **`align-items: flex-end;`**  
   → Moves all frogs to the bottom of the pond.  

6️⃣ **`align-items: center; justify-content: center;`**  
   → Centers the frogs both horizontally and vertically.  

---

### 🔄 **Changing the Main Axis Direction (flex-direction)**
7️⃣ **`justify-content: space-around;`**  
   → Evenly spaces the frogs along the row.  

8️⃣ **`flex-direction: row-reverse;`**  
   → Reverses the row direction (frogs move to the opposite order).  

9️⃣ **`flex-direction: column;`**  
   → Stacks the frogs in a vertical column.  

🔟 **`flex-direction: row-reverse; justify-content: flex-end;`**  
   → Reverses the row order and moves frogs to the right.  

1️⃣1️⃣ **`flex-direction: column; justify-content: flex-end;`**  
   → Stacks the frogs in a column and moves them to the bottom.  

1️⃣2️⃣ **`flex-direction: column-reverse; justify-content: space-between;`**  
   → Stacks frogs in reverse column order, spreading them evenly.  

1️⃣3️⃣ **`flex-direction: row-reverse; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-end;`**  
   → Reverses row order, centers horizontally, and moves frogs to the bottom.  

---

### 🔢 **Controlling Individual Frog Order (order)**
1️⃣4️⃣ **`order: 1;`**  
   → Moves this frog to the end of the row.  

1️⃣5️⃣ **`order: -3;`**  
   → Moves this frog to the beginning of the row.  

---

### 🎯 **Positioning Individual Frogs (align-self)**
1️⃣6️⃣ **`align-self: flex-end;`**  
   → Moves this frog to the bottom, while others stay in place.  

1️⃣7️⃣ **`align-self: flex-end; order: 1;`**  
   → Moves this frog to the bottom **and** shifts it to the end of the row.  

---

### 🏗 **Handling Multiple Rows (flex-wrap)**
1️⃣8️⃣ **`flex-wrap: wrap;`**  
   → Allows frogs to wrap to the next line if needed.  

1️⃣9️⃣ **`flex-direction: column; flex-wrap: wrap;`**  
   → Stacks frogs in a column while allowing wrapping.  

2️⃣0️⃣ **`flex-flow: column wrap;`**  
   → A shorthand for the previous rule (column + wrapping).  

---

### 📦 **Aligning Multiple Rows (align-content)**
2️⃣1️⃣ **`align-content: flex-start;`**  
   → Moves wrapped rows to the top of the pond.  

2️⃣2️⃣ **`align-content: flex-end;`**  
   → Moves wrapped rows to the bottom.  

2️⃣3️⃣ **`flex-direction: column-reverse; align-content: center;`**  
   → Stacks rows in reverse order and centers them.  

2️⃣4️⃣ **`flex-flow: column-reverse wrap-reverse; justify-content: center; align-content: space-between;`**  
   → Stacks in reverse, allows wrapping, centers horizontally, and spreads rows evenly.
